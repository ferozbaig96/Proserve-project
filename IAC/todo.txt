Client -> CF -> S3 (bypassing login)
	- S3 presigned url for watching video + CF domain

Configure sign up email verification via Cognito
	- Cache issue

encryption on s3
	- enabled

FTS bug (dot name bug)
	- fixed

CloudFront health checks on Routet53

CloudFront URL for uploading media
	- done

lambda
	- timeout

apigw
	- correct user pool in authorizer

secrets manager
	- lambda iam role arn

sqs
	- lambda triggers (SAM Serverless Function Event)

Is dependency (DependsOn) assumed when passing Ref?
	- yes, for Ref and GetAtt 
Ref vs Sub?
	- Remove DependsOn

Trigger CreateRdsLambda Once
https://github.com/sophos/cloudformation-random-string

Reference IAM role created automatically by SAM lambda
	- only SQSHandlerLambda needs all permissions
	- CreateRdsTableLambda and SearchVideosLambda needs does NOT need sqs+kms permissions

	- update stackoverflow

s3 (kms-sqs-s3, s3)
	- bucket policy for media bucket (cf)

cognito hosted ui URL is exposed on incorrect credentials & subsequent requests in browser dev tools
	- should not be a cause of concern
